# Star-PCB-555
This is a PCB circuit using LM555 integrated circuit to blink 2 sets of 8 LEDs.

Important parameters:
VCC = 5 V,
R1 = 4.7k ohm,
R2 (potentiometer) = 20k ohm,
C1 = 47 micro Farad.

R1, C1 are size 1210.
LEDs are size 1206.
R2 is 3314J.
555 timer is LM555CM.
Micro USB B female smd.

PCB size 12cm by 12cm.

Calculations:

When R2 = 0 ohm,
Frequency f = 6.519 Hz,
Period T = 0.153 s,
Duty cycle = 100 %.

When R2 = 20k ohm,
Frequency f = 0.685 Hz,
Period T = 1.459 s,
Duty cycle = 55.257 %.
